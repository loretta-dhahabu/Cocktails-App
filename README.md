## Description
This is a Cocktail Application  that displays different varieties of Cocktails and their details i.e from name to being alcoholic or non-alcoholic,the ingredients used,glass used and the date the cocktail was modified. 
It allows the user to such for there preferred drink on the search area as it filters the cocktails by name.
It also gives the users a permission to delete any cocktail they are not interested in though this option is somehow destructive since it will delete the coktail permanently.
Therefore I urge users to delete with caution.
The app again allows users to leave their comments after viewing or using the cocktail.
## Features
A user will be able to: 
1. Search cocktail by name
2. Render/Display a list of cocktails.
3. Delete cocktails
4. Click on View cocktail button to see the details of the specific selected cocktail.
5. Add a comment on the comment section

I used HTML for laying out the structure of the app
The CSS was used to style the web pages
React was used to create interactive UI. Design simple views for each state in my application, and efficiently update and render just the right components when my data changes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/drinks](http://localhost:3000/drinks) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

S
### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
